# DSAproj

A backend algorithm written for a tour guide application of an imaginary amusement park. No work has been done on the UI yet, so the results are shown on the terminal.
The application provides the user with multiple options, i.e to start the tour from the entrance of the park, to begin the tour from a random position, guide the user to the nearest ride, guide the tour to the nearest ride from the selected ride type, guide the user to nearest Bathrooms and utilities, guide the user to a specific ride and etc etc. For all the options, algorithms with best time complexities have been used. The data structure used is an undirected graph and it uses algorithms like BFS, DFS , Dijskttra's algorithm etc.

The code can be easily run on any python compiler.
